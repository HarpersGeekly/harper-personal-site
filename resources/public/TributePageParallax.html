The film received praise and recognition at the Cannes Film Festival winning Best First Work. His career work in the diverse genres of Science Fiction, Historical Epic, Crime Drama, and Comedy Drama are known for stunning visual atmosphere, often depicting adventurers in a foreign land adapting to challenging and hostile circumstances.
